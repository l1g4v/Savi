A simple p2p voice call app made in Rust with Slint

I started this app as something to do while learning another programming lang, apparently it was harder than I expected since I'm full of problems:

- Audio sound "crunchy"
- High cpu usage at random moments
- My lack of understanding of rust multithreading results in weird hacky code
